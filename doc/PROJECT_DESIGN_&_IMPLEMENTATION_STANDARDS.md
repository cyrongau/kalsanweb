Project Directive: 
Design & Implementation Standards

To ensure the final product matches the vision, the following instructions are provided for the engineering team:

1. Color Palette & Visual Identity

Primary Navy (#1D428A): To be used for all primary actions (buttons), navigation bars, active states, and brand-identifying icons.
Secondary Black (#000000): To be used for primary headings, body text for maximum legibility, and high-contrast UI borders.
Clean White (#FFFFFF): To be used as the primary background color for all cards, sections, and pages to maintain the modern, airy feel.


2. Component & UI/UX Standards

Typography: Use a modern, professional sans-serif font (like Inter or Roboto) with a clear hierarchical scale.
Component Styles: All buttons must have consistent border radii (e.g., 4px-8px for a professional look). Cards must use subtle soft shadows rather than harsh borders.
Pixel Perfection: The spacing (padding and margins) defined in the /doc/prototype/ images must be followed exactly to preserve the layout's balance.
Layout Integrity: The "Request for Quote" workflow must be implemented exactly as shown, ensuring the "Add to Quote" interaction feels seamless and distinct from traditional "Add to Cart" retail flows.

3. Administrative Consistency

The Admin Dashboard must use the same professional styling and color tokens as the customer-facing storefront to ensure a unified system experience.
Content and data must be presented in clear, tabular, or card-based views with zero clutter.

4. File Organization

The engineer is instructed to use the files in /doc/prototype/ as the single source of truth for all CSS styles, component layouts, and user interactions.
This concludes the design phase of the Kalsan Auto Spare Parts platform. All screens from the homepage to the deep system settings, including the mobile-responsive views and the administrative suite, are now aligned with these strict brand guidelines.
